            The &kxstitch; main window consists of an editor window shown on the right in the image above
            with three dock windows. The dock windows provide a preview of the pattern, the palette of
            flosses and a history list. If an image is imported, an additional dock window showing a
            preview of the original image for reference will be shown. Each of these dock windows can
            be moved around to various edges of the main window, detached from the view or turned off
            and back on.
        </para>
        <para>
            The sections are divided by splitters, which can be moved to change the amount of space
            allocated to any of the sections.
        </para>
        <para>
            The layout of other elements, menu bar, toolbars and the status bar, is similar to other &kde;
            applications you run.
        </para>
        <para>
            The status bar at the bottom of the window shows various status messages.

    <sect1 id="kxstitch-editor" >
        <title>Editor Window</title>
        <para>
            The main editing window shows a grid pattern and scales top and left. The scales can be formatted
            in stitches, centimeters or inches. The editor is a scrolling, zoomable view of your pattern
            and allows you to use the various editing tools to modify your design.
        </para>
        <para>
            Generally the &LMB; is used to activate any of the tools on the pattern. Details of each of the
            tools and their use is shown in <link linkend="commands">the command reference section</link>.
        </para>
        <para>
            The grid shows heavier lines dividing the cells into groups. The number of cells per group is
            configurable, the default is 10, as are the colors for the lines. This is useful if you are
            creating patterns on a dark colored canvas that requires lighter colored lines for contrast.
        </para>
        <para>
            A menu option allows you to add background images to the editor window, to use as a template for
            adding stitches. For more details see the section on <link linkend="creatingpatterns">Creating Patterns</link>.
        </para>
        <sect2 id="kxstitch-editor-context" >
            <title>Context Menu</title>
            <para>
                Using your &RMB; on the editor will activate a context menu allowing you to change the format
                of the scales and the visual appearance of the stitches. It also allows you to toggle on or off
                the background images, the stitches, backstitches, the grid and the scales.

    <sect1 id="kxstitch-preview" >
        <title>Preview Window</title>
        <para>
            The <guilabel>Preview</guilabel> window shows a scrolling overview of the current design at a smaller scale than the
            Editor window.  The <guilabel>Preview</guilabel> shows a black rectangle representing the current view within the
            Editor window.
        </para>
        <para>
            By clicking the &LMB; within the preview window, the Editor window will be centered on that point.
            Additionally by pressing down the &LMB; and dragging a rectangle around an area, the Editor window
            will be zoomed to encompass that area.
        </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="kxstitch-palette" >
        <title>Palette Window</title>
        <para>
            The <guilabel>Palette</guilabel> window shows the floss colors currently in this patterns palette as colored blocks,
            and optionally with the symbols that are associated with each color.  Moving the mouse pointer
            over a color block will pop up a tool tip showing the color number and name for that color.
            Clicking on a color selects that color for the next painting or drawing function.
        </para>
        <sect2 id="kxstitch-palette-context" >
            <title>Context Menu</title>
            <para>
                Using your &RMB; on the <guilabel>Palette</guilabel> view will activate a context menu allowing you to perform several
                functions on the palette. See <link linkend="commands">the command reference</link> for more details on their use.
