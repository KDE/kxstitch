 * @brief Manages the library of symbols.
 *
 * The symbol library holds all the symbols that have been added to it or loaded from a file.
 * The symbols are indexed and the index is incremented for each symbol added starting from 1.
 * When a SymbolListWidget is assigned to the SymbolLibrary each of the symbols is added to
 * the SymbolListWidget which will create a QListWidgetItem which is assigned the QIcon that
 * is generated from the QPainterPath associated with the index.
