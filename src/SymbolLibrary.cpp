/**
 * @file
 * Implement the SymbolLibrary class
 */

/**
 * @page symbol_library Symbol Library
 * The symbols created are stored in symbol files. A number of different files can be created containing symbols
 * of different themes. When files are opened the symbol library will be populated with the contents of the file.
 *
 * The symbol library can be associated with a LibraryListWidget which will provide an icon view of all the
 * existing symbols. Clicking on one of the icons will open this symbol in the editor and allow it to be modified.
 * New symbols created can be saved to the library.
 *
 * Note that symbols saved to the library are not immediately saved to disk. The user is required to save the
 * library with the File->Save command. The user may also use the File->Save As command to save the library to a
 * different file.
 *
 * @image html ui-main-library.png "The user interface showing the library tab"
 *
 * All changes to the library through adding new symbols, editing a symbol or importing a library can be undone
 * or redone with the undo and redo commands. A separate undo stack is managed for the library and for the editor
 * and the active one is dependent on which of the tabs is selected. Undoing commands in the editor tab does not
 * affect the library, similarly undoing commands in the library does not affect the editor.
 *
 * A context menu is available for the symbols in the list allowing individual symbols to be deleted. This can be
 * undone if required.
 *
 * Using the File->Import Library it is also possible to import symbols from another symbol file into the current
 * symbol library. These will then be appended to the current set of symbols.
 *
 * File->Close will close the current library leaving a new empty library that new symbols can be added to.
